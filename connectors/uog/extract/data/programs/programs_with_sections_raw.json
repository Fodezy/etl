Departmental courses include most of the core theory and methods courses as well as many elective courses.

While this is also done in the classroom, co-op students will gain a different perspective on these as critical to workplace success.\nDemonstrate personal, professional, and academic integrity and ethical reasoning: Through work terms, students will gain further insight into the importance of professional ethics and integrity, which will further their personal and academic integrity and ethical reasoning in other aspects of the program and outside of the classroom.\nDemonstrate personal responsibility and initiative for current and on-going learning: Many workplaces require initiative and on-going learning, and gaining practical knowledge and experience of this in work terms will build students’ capacity both inside and outside of the classroom."

It focuses on nutrition from a preventive, maintenance and therapeutic perspective, all of which require a thorough understanding of the related biological sciences and of selected aspects of the behavioral sciences. Students learn about nutrition and its application to the maintenance of health and the prevention and treatment of disease. They also learn about individual and social behaviour, particularly in family settings, and the implications of behavioral factors in the establishment of good nutrition status from conception through to old age. Through the effective use of elective courses, the core requirements in the Major can be supplemented to create a program of study which will prepare graduates for a variety of health and education careers in the government or private sectors, or with the food industry. Others may proceed to graduate study in fields such as nutrition, public health nutrition, medicine or education.",

Successful completion of the additional required and restricted elective courses, required to meet the Integrated Competencies for Dietetic Education and Practice (ICDEP) as part of this professional education program, will allow students to compete for a limited number of dietetic internship positions/practicum programs after graduation. Graduates who complete dietetic internships/practicum programs are eligible to write the Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination, a national registration examination and become Registered Dietitians, a regulated health profession. The Area of Emphasis in this dietetic education program is accredited under Accreditation Canada’s EQual program and prepares students for eligibility for registration with a provincial dietetics regulatory body. Most graduates completing dietetic internships are employed in hospitals and other health care agencies such as community health centres and long-term care facilities where the credential of Registered Dietitian is required for practice. Some Registered Dietitians also find employment in a wide range of careers in health and education, and in the private sector. Still others proceed to graduate study in fields such as nutrition, public health nutrition, medicine or education.",

Academic departments offer the minors and assign faculty advisors to assist students with academic planning (e.g., a faculty advisor in the Psychology department handles queries about a minor in Psychology). Students should consult the appropriate faculty advisor, along with the B.A.Sc. Program Counsellor, when declaring a minor or requiring advice on the completion of specialization requirements.

The requirements for the honours program is a minimum of 20.00 credits (usually 40 semester courses) which may be obtained over 8 semesters of study. Some majors may require more than 20.00 credits.",
          "Most of the B.Sc. programs operate on the three semester system. In this system each of the Fall, Winter and Summer semesters is of 12 weeks duration. Two semesters are equivalent to 1 academic year at a university on the traditional system. In the three semester system, students may vary their rate of progress towards graduation. However, since many science courses must be taken in a certain sequence and not all courses are offered each semester, most science students are required to proceed from semester to semester in restricted patterns. Furthermore, the majority of courses of the honours programs are offered only in the regular fall and winter semesters.",

The three-semester system and the pass-by-course method of advancement allow considerable flexibility of program arrangement. In addition, a variety of program contents is available which the student may modify to meet individual requirements.",
          "On entrance to the B.Sc. program, the student may elect to follow an intended area of specialization or to postpone this decision until a later semester. The choice of a particular program of study may be most effectively made at the end of Semester 3 or 4. Judicious selection of courses in each and every semester will allow the easiest transfer between programs without incurring the need for additional semesters of study. The program counsellor of the particular college from which it is anticipated that the majority of science courses will be taken should be consulted for advice.",

          "In their course of study, majors explore three writing genres, gain expertise in two, and create a polished creative portfolio in one while minors gain skill in two writing genres. By the end of the program, students will be able to create original, compelling creative work by achieving a breadth and understanding of the techniques of creative craft and form across two genres.",
          "The Creative Writing minor reflects the significant role that creative writing plays in our cultural life, from travel writing and blogs, gaming and journalism, to poems, novels and films. The minor hones students’ skills in expressive writing, and teaches students to situate their work within a broader context of local, global and historical creative texts. Workshops and a capstone seminar provide students with the opportunity to revise their work and develop a creative portfolio.",

          "The CTS major offers students in the College of Arts a unique and flexible program of study with which to explore the role of culture and creativity in an increasingly technological world, using technologies themselves as part of the process. It emerges from the insight that technology is inextricably linked to human experience, culture, and society. Students in CTS will tackle the complex relationships among power, digital knowledge, digital cultures, the representation of data, and the ethical questions surrounding the development, deployment, and accessibility of technological objects and processes. CTS builds an understanding of the digital mediation of cultural processes and the role humans play in technological work. CTS majors learn digital methods for intervening in the contemporary world as versatile creators, curators, communicators, and citizens.",
          "The CTS Co-op program provides an integrated academic/work experience for students with co-operating employer organizations. Students in the program complete 3-4 work terms while fulfilling the requirements of their CTS major."

Eng. program follow Schedule 6 Regulations, as outlined below. Transfer students from another university or college and students who are readmitted but whose prior record renders them ineligible to proceed under Schedule 6 will follow Schedule 2 (see Chapter VIII). Students will be ineligible to continue in the B.Eng. program and will not be readmitted to the degree program if the same course is failed three times.",
          "Normally, students in the B.Eng. program will be permitted only one supplemental assessment during their studies. It will usually be granted for 3000 or 4000 level courses only.",
          "All degree programs, Open Learning and General Studies have established conditions which must be met for continuation of study. Continuation of study within a program is permitted provided the standards of academic performance listed below are met. In some instances, students not meeting the requirements may be allowed to proceed on probation (see Academic Standing-Probationary(https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/undergraduate-degree-regulations-procedures/academic-standing/)). If these conditions are not met, the student will be required to withdraw from the program for a minimum of two semesters and may apply for readmission after that period of time.",
          "The continuation of study regulations at the University of Guelph are based on the principle that students must maintain a minimum average of 60%. To allow for transition issues, some leniency has been built into the minimum average requirement during the first 5.25 credit attempts in the B.Eng. program. The student's cumulative average will be reviewed first. If the student's cumulative average does not meet the minimum required, the student will either be required to withdraw or placed on probation. When a student is placed on probation the student will be required to obtain a minimum semester average. In subsequent semesters the student will either be required to withdraw, allowed to continue on probation, or be placed back on regular status. Students will be taken off probation once their cumulative average is greater than, or equal to 60%.",
          "Conditions for continuation of study are applied using the following tables:",

The integration of biophysical sciences with real-world applications provides students with a unique skill set for engaging with current and future environmental issues. The many opportunities in the major for experiential learning and independent research give students an ability to collect, analyze and interpret environmental data, and propose solutions that account for both the biophysical science and the socio-economic context. The second year core curriculum develops a cross-disciplinary understanding of the biophysical environment, while the third and fourth years allow students to engage more deeply with issues of interest to them. Students will graduate from this major ready to address diverse problems such as pollinator conservation, soil and water conservation, greenhouse gas mitigation, plant disease management and chemical movement in the environment. It provides a solid background for careers in environmental protection, resource management and research, in both the public and private sectors."

Management of public entities features a unique set of challenges that arise from and interact with basic political issues like democracy, accountability, equity, fairness, and justice. At the same time, it necessarily faces concerns common to all organizations, such as efficiency, human and capital resource management, morale, planning, and adaptation to change.",
          "The major will appeal to students interested in the public service, public sector businesses or business-government relations.",
          "A principal aim of the Co-op program in Government, Economics and Management is to facilitate the transition of students from academic studies to a professional career by enhancing the integration of theory and practice.",
          "Students enrolled in the GEM major can choose to complete three of the five required courses for the Certificate in Leadership as part of their requirements for the major if they choose the appropriate restricted electives. If you would like to graduate both with a BComm degree and the Certificate in Leadership you should use two of your free electives to enroll in HROB*2010 Foundations of Leadership in either semester 3 or 6 and HROB*4010 Leadership Certificate Capstone in semester 8. In addition to the five degree-credit courses selected from the above list, 120 hours of leadership practice are required to obtain the undergraduate Certificate in Leadership. See http://www.leadershipcertificate.com/ for information regarding this Certificate and its course requirements.",

        "This area of emphasis focuses on the need for development to be viewed through the lens of inclusivity, most notably with respect to gender.  It explores the ways in which development often acts to exclude or negatively impact women and other marginalized groups, and the need for development policies and programs to be designed and implemented in a manner that promotes inclusivity with respect to gender. The notion of gender-inclusive development is examined through the perspective of intersectionality. Whilst particular attention is given to gender, there is also examination of sexuality, race, indigeneity and other dimensions of marginalization.",

In this major, students will build upon core courses in ecology, evolution, genetics, and physiology of aquatic biota as they study freshwater and marine environments and work with aquatic organisms experimentally in the field and in the lab. They will have the opportunity to perform independent research projects under a variety of field and laboratory conditions to enhance their learning experience. The major prepares students for post-graduate work in the aquatic sciences, and provides a sound scientific background for students wishing to pursue careers in academia, government service, private sector (e.g., NGOs, fisheries, aquaculture, biotechnology, consulting), conservation, education and research."

Departmental courses include most of the core theory and methods courses as well as many elective courses.

          "Students in this program obtain a liberal engineering education, which includes a comprehensive core of science, mathematics and engineering science that provides a strong foundation for engineering design and analysis. This foundation enables students to identify and solve engineering problems in the areas of biological, biomedical, computer, engineering systems and computing, environmental, mechanical and water resources. Core subjects, combined with elective opportunities, provide an understanding of the connection between engineering and science, coupled with the interdisciplinary skills needed to address the problems and challenges faced by engineers in society today.",
          "The curriculum includes a strong emphasis on engineering design. Students engage in engineering design throughout the program, and gain experience in computer aided design and modeling, conceptual design, and physical construction. Emphasis is on teamwork and communications skills, and working on interdisciplinary projects.",
          "Career opportunities are open in many segments of the economy. Examples are: consulting services to municipalities, utilities and industry; resource agencies in advisory, regulatory, planning and utilization; service industries of construction, power and water supply and public health; manufacturing, design of computer and control systems, hardware and software development; mechatronics and emerging energy systems; medical devices, pharmaceutical and food industries and industrial ergonomics; academic research and graduate studies both within and outside the field of engineering.",
          "Many engineers assume management responsibilities after gaining experience in design, development and operations. The balance provided by liberal arts and engineering education allows graduates to enjoy a great deal of career mobility.",
          "The baccalaureate degree programs in all engineering programs are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board of Engineers Canada. Graduates from accredited engineering programs have the educational requirements to apply for membership in the Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO) and other provinces after a number of years of acceptable engineering experience and successful completion of a professional practice examination in engineering law and ethics.",
          "Students combine their required courses in mathematics, physical sciences and engineering with additional credits providing the opportunity for specialization in one of the B.Eng. majors, including complementary studies and elective subjects. Complementary studies consist of courses in the humanities and social sciences; sustainable development and environmental stewardship; project management and economics, including engineering economics; and communication. Complementary studies complement the technical content of the curriculum by enhancing an understanding of the role of engineering in society. All credits are selected according to the schedule of studies for the student's chosen B.Eng. program. Further information on approved courses may be obtained from the B.Eng. Program Guide available on the School of Engineering website.",

The application must be submitted by the last day of classes in the semester preceding the change. Admission is competitive based on available space in each major. Normally, only those applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements for internal transfer are considered (see https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/undergraduate-degree-regulations-procedures/transfer-program/) . Applications are assessed by the B.Eng. Admission Committee and decisions regarding applications are made no later than one week before the add deadline of the following semester.

          "Students should note that completion of a minor will require additional credits beyond the total number of credits required for their BEng major. Students intending to acquire a minor should consult with their Program Counsellor. Students cannot earn a minor in the same subject area as their major.",
          "Students may not triple-count a course between a B.Eng. major and two or more minors.",

Eng. program follow Schedule 6 Regulations, as outlined below. Transfer students from another university or college and students who are readmitted but whose prior record renders them ineligible to proceed under Schedule 6 will follow Schedule 2 (see Chapter VIII). Students will be ineligible to continue in the B.Eng. program and will not be readmitted to the degree program if the same course is failed three times.",
          "Normally, students in the B.Eng. program will be permitted only one supplemental assessment during their studies. It will usually be granted for 3000 or 4000 level courses only.",
          "All degree programs, Open Learning and General Studies have established conditions which must be met for continuation of study. Continuation of study within a program is permitted provided the standards of academic performance listed below are met. In some instances, students not meeting the requirements may be allowed to proceed on probation (see Academic Standing-Probationary(https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/undergraduate-degree-regulations-procedures/academic-standing/)). If these conditions are not met, the student will be required to withdraw from the program for a minimum of two semesters and may apply for readmission after that period of time.",
          "The continuation of study regulations at the University of Guelph are based on the principle that students must maintain a minimum average of 60%. To allow for transition issues, some leniency has been built into the minimum average requirement during the first 5.25 credit attempts in the B.Eng. program. The student's cumulative average will be reviewed first. If the student's cumulative average does not meet the minimum required, the student will either be required to withdraw or placed on probation. When a student is placed on probation the student will be required to obtain a minimum semester average. In subsequent semesters the student will either be required to withdraw, allowed to continue on probation, or be placed back on regular status. Students will be taken off probation once their cumulative average is greater than, or equal to 60%.",
          "Conditions for continuation of study are applied using the following tables:",
          "B.Eng. students who have attempted between 0.25 and 2.75 credits will be allowed to continue regardless of the cumulative average. Students will be placed on probation if their cumulative average falls below 50%.",
