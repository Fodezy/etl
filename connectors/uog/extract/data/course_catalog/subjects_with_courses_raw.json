Does God exist or is belief in God merely a myth? In this course, we will take a historical approach to the central issues of philosophy by examining such questions as: What is the nature of reality (metaphysics)? What can we know (epistemology)? Do good and evil exist (ethics)? What is beauty (aesthetics)? Through the investigation of these timeless questions, we will participate in \"the great conversation\" that has shaped the world in which we live. This course continues the historical approach to the central problems of philosophy. Students will study the modern and more contemporary philosophers who have influenced our understanding of modernity. Beginning with Descartes, the Utilitarians will be studied. The course will also examine Nietzsche's critique of conventional morality and rationalistic philosophy.\n\n\nDepartment(s):\nLiberal Studies, Psychology",

Most classes include experiential compositional engagements, inviting solo, small group and whole class activities. Through readings of published work, instructor talks, and group discussions, we ask questions about the conceptual, sociopolitical and critical underpinnings poets propose when approaching poetry with innovative intentions. We inquire into examples of how poets have experimented with alphabet, language, asemics, concrete poetics, procedural constraints (i.e. erasure/palimpsest), listening, sounding and orality, improvisation, polyvocality, digital media, and other text/image/material explorations, while cultivating individual new poetry from all class participants. Final projects might include a reading of new work, a class performance, as well as a constructed language object.\n\n\nRestriction(s):\nRestricted to MFA Creative Writing students.\nDepartment(s):\nSchool of Theatre, English, and Creative Writing\nOffering(s):\nOffered in odd-numbered years.",

System behaviours will be analyzed by solving for such responses as the impulse response, step response, and sinusoidal steady-state response using differential equations, Laplace transform methods, and computer-based methods. The relationship of such system parameters as time constant, degree of damping and resonance frequencies with the transient and steady-state responses will be examined.

The course will examine the scope and integrative nature of One Health and its historical development; explore concepts of health from scientific and socio-cultural perspectives; introduce a basic framework for Open Health inquiry; and relate current challenges such as climate change, pollution and environmental contamination, emerging and zoonotic diseases, antimicrobial resistance, bio- and cultural diversity loss, and food insecurity to a One Health perspective. Key skills such as systems thinking, communication and professionalism in the field of One Health will also be developed.\n\n\nDepartment(s):\nDepartment of Integrative Biology",
