The departmental category of courses recognizes the fact that the disciplines of sociology and sociocultural anthropology have developed in tandem and it is possible to identify large areas of overlap and convergence in the work of practitioners both historically and in the present. Departmental courses include most of the core theory and methods courses as well as many elective courses. They contribute equally to the subject matter of sociology as well as the subject matter of sociocultural anthropology for purposes of the undergraduate programs of study in both disciplines.

This will further their ability to critically reflect on these things inside the classroom as well.\nInterpret, use and mobilize historical and contemporary disciplinary knowledge for a variety of audiences: Work terms are likely to include the need to write reports for different stakeholders/readers, and as such, students will be able to enhance their writing and knowledge translation skills.\nApply anthropological theories and methods to develop and evaluate policy: This will also be enhanced through work terms, given that we expect some work terms to involve governmental or private organizations that create and implement policies.\nDemonstrate leadership, teamwork, personal organization and time management: Each of these are critical in a workplace, and students in work placements will gain practical understandings of how to work in teams, best manage time and personal accountability, and gain insight into leadership. While this is also done in the classroom, co-op students will gain a different perspective on these as critical to workplace success.\nDemonstrate personal, professional, and academic integrity and ethical reasoning: Through work terms, students will gain further insight into the importance of professional ethics and integrity, which will further their personal and academic integrity and ethical reasoning in other aspects of the program and outside of the classroom.\nDemonstrate personal responsibility and initiative for current and on-going learning: Many workplaces require initiative and on-going learning, and gaining practical knowledge and experience of this in work terms will build students’ capacity both inside and outside of the classroom."

It focuses on nutrition from a preventive, maintenance and therapeutic perspective, all of which require a thorough understanding of the related biological sciences and of selected aspects of the behavioral sciences. Students learn about nutrition and its application to the maintenance of health and the prevention and treatment of disease. They also learn about individual and social behaviour, particularly in family settings, and the implications of behavioral factors in the establishment of good nutrition status from conception through to old age. Through the effective use of elective courses, the core requirements in the Major can be supplemented to create a program of study which will prepare graduates for a variety of health and education careers in the government or private sectors, or with the food industry.

Graduates who complete dietetic internships/practicum programs are eligible to write the Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination, a national registration examination and become Registered Dietitians, a regulated health profession. The Area of Emphasis in this dietetic education program is accredited under Accreditation Canada’s EQual program and prepares students for eligibility for registration with a provincial dietetics regulatory body. Most graduates completing dietetic internships are employed in hospitals and other health care agencies such as community health centres and long-term care facilities where the credential of Registered Dietitian is required for practice. Some Registered Dietitians also find employment in a wide range of careers in health and education, and in the private sector.

The program prepares students well for more advanced studies or applied training in many health-related fields including clinical practice, business, government, research and education. Through the use of electives, students may structure a program emphasizing aspects of health and disease. For more information on recommended electives contact the Faculty Advisor of the major.",

Continuation from first to second year is based on the cumulative average in the first two semesters (total of 5.00 credits), including the eight core courses as prescribed by the Schedule of Studies (see below). Students with a minimum average of 75% average will be guaranteed continuation in this major. For students with a 70-74.9% average, continuation will be competitive based on available spaces. Students with an average below 70% will be changed to the Biological Science major. Students may subsequently change to another B.Sc. major of their choice.",

Ways of working with children in diverse and inclusive settings are explored, and the importance of early learning opportunities and early intervention are emphasized. Students gain both theoretical knowledge and applied skills through course work and guaranteed practicum placements, completing over 500 hours of practical experience working with children in a variety of settings. Graduates of the Child Studies major are eligible to apply for membership in the College of Early Childhood Educators.",
          "Through the effective use of elective courses, the core requirements in the major can be supplemented to create a program of study that will prepare graduates for a variety of careers working with children and their families. Graduates pursue careers in diverse settings including elementary schools, paediatric wards in hospitals, family and community service agencies, child care centres, and child and youth treatment facilities. Many students go on to pursue graduate education in fields such as education, social work, speech language pathology, occupational therapy, child life, nursing, psychology, couple and family therapy, sociology, and family studies.",
          "All students in the Child Studies major must successfully complete a minimum of 20.00 credits including the core of 13.50 required credits. In addition to the core requirements, there are elective courses from various departments across the University that may be taken. Information about suggested electives that relate to particular careers or areas of interest and requirements for admission to various graduate programs, including Faculties of Education, are available from the B.A.Sc. Program Counsellor.",

To allow for transition issues, some leniency has been built into the minimum average requirement during the first 5.25 credit attempts in the B.Eng. program. The student's cumulative average will be reviewed first. If the student's cumulative average does not meet the minimum required, the student will either be required to withdraw or placed on probation. When a student is placed on probation the student will be required to obtain a minimum semester average. In subsequent semesters the student will either be required to withdraw, allowed to continue on probation, or be placed back on regular status. Students will be taken off probation once their cumulative average is greater than, or equal to 60%.",

          "The CTS major offers students in the College of Arts a unique and flexible program of study with which to explore the role of culture and creativity in an increasingly technological world, using technologies themselves as part of the process. It emerges from the insight that technology is inextricably linked to human experience, culture, and society. Students in CTS will tackle the complex relationships among power, digital knowledge, digital cultures, the representation of data, and the ethical questions surrounding the development, deployment, and accessibility of technological objects and processes. CTS builds an understanding of the digital mediation of cultural processes and the role humans play in technological work. CTS majors learn digital methods for intervening in the contemporary world as versatile creators, curators, communicators, and citizens.",
          "The CTS Co-op program provides an integrated academic/work experience for students with co-operating employer organizations. Students in the program complete 3-4 work terms while fulfilling the requirements of their CTS major."

A practical perspective based on defining and resolving problems is central to the program, and this is often done in the context of group work.",
          "Substantial emphasis is placed on communication skills, including the development of competence in both written and oral presentations. These skills will be progressively developed in core courses from the first to the fourth year. Students in the final year of their program will be expected to take part in more intensive communication skill development. Graduates will seek employment in a range of fields, from government agencies to private industry and research.",

          "Students in this program obtain a liberal engineering education, which includes a comprehensive core of science, mathematics and engineering science that provides a strong foundation for engineering design and analysis. This foundation enables students to identify and solve engineering problems in the areas of biological, biomedical, computer, engineering systems and computing, environmental, mechanical and water resources. Core subjects, combined with elective opportunities, provide an understanding of the connection between engineering and science, coupled with the interdisciplinary skills needed to address the problems and challenges faced by engineers in society today.",
          "The curriculum includes a strong emphasis on engineering design. Students engage in engineering design throughout the program, and gain experience in computer aided design and modeling, conceptual design, and physical construction. Emphasis is on teamwork and communications skills, and working on interdisciplinary projects.",
          "Career opportunities are open in many segments of the economy. Examples are: consulting services to municipalities, utilities and industry; resource agencies in advisory, regulatory, planning and utilization; service industries of construction, power and water supply and public health; manufacturing, design of computer and control systems, hardware and software development; mechatronics and emerging energy systems; medical devices, pharmaceutical and food industries and industrial ergonomics; academic research and graduate studies both within and outside the field of engineering.",

To allow for transition issues, some leniency has been built into the minimum average requirement during the first 5.25 credit attempts in the B.Eng. program. The student's cumulative average will be reviewed first. If the student's cumulative average does not meet the minimum required, the student will either be required to withdraw or placed on probation. When a student is placed on probation the student will be required to obtain a minimum semester average. In subsequent semesters the student will either be required to withdraw, allowed to continue on probation, or be placed back on regular status. Students will be taken off probation once their cumulative average is greater than, or equal to 60%.",

The program combines a solid background in business, biological sciences and equine management through practical and theoretical experience. It provides in-depth understanding of the economic, environmental and social dimensions of all equine disciplines with a broad and current knowledge of horse industry issues and develops the skills to gather, access, interpret and apply industry data. In consultation with the faculty advisor, students can participate in international exchange. Students can also incorporate a variety of field trips, experiential learning in the workplace and independent research projects into their program.",

Students who are considering this option should contact their program counselor early in their studies. Prospective candidates for the DVM program should consult the admission requirements for the program.",
          "Students taking the degree may also take a minor in another subject area. A maximum of 50% of the requirements of a minor may be applied to meet the requirements of the BBRM.EQM or BBRM.EQM:C program. Students should note that completion of a minor may require additional credits beyond the 20.00 required for the program. Students intending to acquire a minor should consult with their Program Counsellor."

          "Students in this program obtain a liberal engineering education, which includes a comprehensive core of science, mathematics and engineering science that provides a strong foundation for engineering design and analysis. This foundation enables students to identify and solve engineering problems in the areas of biological, biomedical, computer, engineering systems and computing, environmental, mechanical and water resources. Core subjects, combined with elective opportunities, provide an understanding of the connection between engineering and science, coupled with the interdisciplinary skills needed to address the problems and challenges faced by engineers in society today.",
          "The curriculum includes a strong emphasis on engineering design. Students engage in engineering design throughout the program, and gain experience in computer aided design and modeling, conceptual design, and physical construction. Emphasis is on teamwork and communications skills, and working on interdisciplinary projects.",
          "Career opportunities are open in many segments of the economy. Examples are: consulting services to municipalities, utilities and industry; resource agencies in advisory, regulatory, planning and utilization; service industries of construction, power and water supply and public health; manufacturing, design of computer and control systems, hardware and software development; mechatronics and emerging energy systems; medical devices, pharmaceutical and food industries and industrial ergonomics; academic research and graduate studies both within and outside the field of engineering.",
          "Many engineers assume management responsibilities after gaining experience in design, development and operations. The balance provided by liberal arts and engineering education allows graduates to enjoy a great deal of career mobility.",
          "The baccalaureate degree programs in all engineering programs are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board of Engineers Canada. Graduates from accredited engineering programs have the educational requirements to apply for membership in the Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO) and other provinces after a number of years of acceptable engineering experience and successful completion of a professional practice examination in engineering law and ethics.",
          "Students combine their required courses in mathematics, physical sciences and engineering with additional credits providing the opportunity for specialization in one of the B.Eng. majors, including complementary studies and elective subjects. Complementary studies consist of courses in the humanities and social sciences; sustainable development and environmental stewardship; project management and economics, including engineering economics; and communication. Complementary studies complement the technical content of the curriculum by enhancing an understanding of the role of engineering in society. All credits are selected according to the schedule of studies for the student's chosen B.Eng. program. Further information on approved courses may be obtained from the B.Eng. Program Guide available on the School of Engineering website.",
          "Students admitted to the Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) program may apply to transfer between majors once enrolled.",
          "BEng students who wish to change to another major in the program may submit an application to the School of Engineering Program Counselling Office. The application must be submitted by the last day of classes in the semester preceding the change. Admission is competitive based on available space in each major. Normally, only those applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements for internal transfer are considered (see https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/undergraduate-degree-regulations-procedures/transfer-program/) . Applications are assessed by the B.Eng. Admission Committee and decisions regarding applications are made no later than one week before the add deadline of the following semester. Students who change majors may be off sequence and may be required to take additional courses.",

          "Students should note that completion of a minor will require additional credits beyond the total number of credits required for their BEng major. Students intending to acquire a minor should consult with their Program Counsellor. Students cannot earn a minor in the same subject area as their major.",
          "Students may not triple-count a course between a B.Eng. major and two or more minors.",
          "Given the professional and applied nature of the B.Eng. program, there are no double majors associated with the degree.",
          "A maximum of 1.50 credits of core (required) courses may be taken by Letter of Permission for their degree. This cap does not apply to restricted or free electives. Approval of the request for Letter of Permission depends on good standing in the program with a minimum cumulative average of 60%.",

Eng. program follow Schedule 6 Regulations, as outlined below. Transfer students from another university or college and students who are readmitted but whose prior record renders them ineligible to proceed under Schedule 6 will follow Schedule 2 (see Chapter VIII). Students will be ineligible to continue in the B.Eng. program and will not be readmitted to the degree program if the same course is failed three times.",

          "All degree programs, Open Learning and General Studies have established conditions which must be met for continuation of study. Continuation of study within a program is permitted provided the standards of academic performance listed below are met. In some instances, students not meeting the requirements may be allowed to proceed on probation (see Academic Standing-Probationary(https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/undergraduate-degree-regulations-procedures/academic-standing/)). If these conditions are not met, the student will be required to withdraw from the program for a minimum of two semesters and may apply for readmission after that period of time.",
          "The continuation of study regulations at the University of Guelph are based on the principle that students must maintain a minimum average of 60%. To allow for transition issues, some leniency has been built into the minimum average requirement during the first 5.25 credit attempts in the B.Eng. program. The student's cumulative average will be reviewed first. If the student's cumulative average does not meet the minimum required, the student will either be required to withdraw or placed on probation. When a student is placed on probation the student will be required to obtain a minimum semester average. In subsequent semesters the student will either be required to withdraw, allowed to continue on probation, or be placed back on regular status. Students will be taken off probation once their cumulative average is greater than, or equal to 60%.",
          "Conditions for continuation of study are applied using the following tables:",
          "B.Eng. students who have attempted between 0.25 and 2.75 credits will be allowed to continue regardless of the cumulative average. Students will be placed on probation if their cumulative average falls below 50%.",

          "The Co-operative Education program provides an excellent opportunity for students to obtain work experience in industry directly related to their field of study. Students wishing to participate in the Co-operative Education program are encouraged to apply for admission to the Co-op program on entrance. In-course applicants will be considered for admission to the Co-op program following the completion of Semester 2, if space permits.",
          "Students registered in a B.Eng. Co-operative Education program may participate in work-term experience following the completion of the first 4 semesters of study. The Co-operative Education program consists of five co-op work term semesters of experience in industry with employers who participate in the program. Co-op Work Term Reports are graded by a Co-op Faculty Advisor and the Work Performance Evaluation is completed by the co-op employer supervisor rating the student’s work performance during the co-op work term. Evaluations of Co-op semesters are recorded on the student's academic record.",

The integration of biophysical sciences with real-world applications provides students with a unique skill set for engaging with current and future environmental issues. The many opportunities in the major for experiential learning and independent research give students an ability to collect, analyze and interpret environmental data, and propose solutions that account for both the biophysical science and the socio-economic context. The second year core curriculum develops a cross-disciplinary understanding of the biophysical environment, while the third and fourth years allow students to engage more deeply with issues of interest to them. Students will graduate from this major ready to address diverse problems such as pollinator conservation, soil and water conservation, greenhouse gas mitigation, plant disease management and chemical movement in the environment. It provides a solid background for careers in environmental protection, resource management and research, in both the public and private sectors."

          "The major in Equine Management focuses on the development of leaders with a genuine regard for all horses and their well-being, a conscious concern for the environment, and a passionate interest in all aspects of the horse industry. The program combines a solid background in business, biological sciences and equine management through practical and theoretical experience. It provides in-depth understanding of the economic, environmental and social dimensions of all equine disciplines with a broad and current knowledge of horse industry issues and develops the skills to gather, access, interpret and apply industry data. In consultation with the faculty advisor, students can participate in international exchange. Students can also incorporate a variety of field trips, experiential learning in the workplace and independent research projects into their program.",
          "This program is designed to partially meet the current requirements for entry into the DVM program of the Ontario Veterinary College. Students who are considering this option should contact their program counselor early in their studies. Prospective candidates for the DVM program should consult the admission requirements for the program.",
          "Students taking the degree may also take a minor in another subject area. A maximum of 50% of the requirements of a minor may be applied to meet the requirements of the BBRM.EQM or BBRM.EQM:C program. Students should note that completion of a minor may require additional credits beyond the 20.00 required for the program. Students intending to acquire a minor should consult with their Program Counsellor."

          "The Government, Economics and Management major is designed to lead to an understanding of public sector administration and management from the \"inside\" - as an integrated enterprise - as well as from the outside - as a series of policy decisions and outcomes. Characterized by a multi-disciplinary approach employing political, economic and business-oriented analysis, students will confront questions of why politicians and public servants behave the way they do, and how their policy choices and processes can be optimized. Management of public entities features a unique set of challenges that arise from and interact with basic political issues like democracy, accountability, equity, fairness, and justice. At the same time, it necessarily faces concerns common to all organizations, such as efficiency, human and capital resource management, morale, planning, and adaptation to change.",

In addition to the five degree-credit courses selected from the above list, 120 hours of leadership practice are required to obtain the undergraduate Certificate in Leadership.

In this major, students will build upon core courses in ecology, evolution, genetics, and physiology of aquatic biota as they study freshwater and marine environments and work with aquatic organisms experimentally in the field and in the lab. They will have the opportunity to perform independent research projects under a variety of field and laboratory conditions to enhance their learning experience. The major prepares students for post-graduate work in the aquatic sciences, and provides a sound scientific background for students wishing to pursue careers in academia, government service, private sector (e.g., NGOs, fisheries, aquaculture, biotechnology, consulting), conservation, education and research."

This includes learning the history of these subjects as well as understanding current debates. In gaining this knowledge students develop crucial skills of articulation, critical thinking, intellectual independence and the ability to understand others’ viewpoints and assumptions. It is important that students discuss their programs with a Faculty Advisor (Faculty Advisors | University of Guelph) in order to ensure that the best selection of elective Philosophy courses is made. This is especially important for students who are contemplating graduate work in Philosophy."

Departmental courses include most of the core theory and methods courses as well as many elective courses.

          "Students in this program obtain a liberal engineering education, which includes a comprehensive core of science, mathematics and engineering science that provides a strong foundation for engineering design and analysis. This foundation enables students to identify and solve engineering problems in the areas of biological, biomedical, computer, engineering systems and computing, environmental, mechanical and water resources. Core subjects, combined with elective opportunities, provide an understanding of the connection between engineering and science, coupled with the interdisciplinary skills needed to address the problems and challenges faced by engineers in society today.",
          "The curriculum includes a strong emphasis on engineering design. Students engage in engineering design throughout the program, and gain experience in computer aided design and modeling, conceptual design, and physical construction. Emphasis is on teamwork and communications skills, and working on interdisciplinary projects.",
          "Career opportunities are open in many segments of the economy. Examples are: consulting services to municipalities, utilities and industry; resource agencies in advisory, regulatory, planning and utilization; service industries of construction, power and water supply and public health; manufacturing, design of computer and control systems, hardware and software development; mechatronics and emerging energy systems; medical devices, pharmaceutical and food industries and industrial ergonomics; academic research and graduate studies both within and outside the field of engineering.",
          "Many engineers assume management responsibilities after gaining experience in design, development and operations. The balance provided by liberal arts and engineering education allows graduates to enjoy a great deal of career mobility.",
          "The baccalaureate degree programs in all engineering programs are accredited by the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board of Engineers Canada. Graduates from accredited engineering programs have the educational requirements to apply for membership in the Professional Engineers Ontario (PEO) and other provinces after a number of years of acceptable engineering experience and successful completion of a professional practice examination in engineering law and ethics.",
          "Students combine their required courses in mathematics, physical sciences and engineering with additional credits providing the opportunity for specialization in one of the B.Eng. majors, including complementary studies and elective subjects. Complementary studies consist of courses in the humanities and social sciences; sustainable development and environmental stewardship; project management and economics, including engineering economics; and communication. Complementary studies complement the technical content of the curriculum by enhancing an understanding of the role of engineering in society. All credits are selected according to the schedule of studies for the student's chosen B.Eng. program. Further information on approved courses may be obtained from the B.Eng. Program Guide available on the School of Engineering website.",
          "Students admitted to the Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) program may apply to transfer between majors once enrolled.",
          "BEng students who wish to change to another major in the program may submit an application to the School of Engineering Program Counselling Office. The application must be submitted by the last day of classes in the semester preceding the change. Admission is competitive based on available space in each major. Normally, only those applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements for internal transfer are considered (see https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/undergraduate-degree-regulations-procedures/transfer-program/) . Applications are assessed by the B.Eng. Admission Committee and decisions regarding applications are made no later than one week before the add deadline of the following semester. Students who change majors may be off sequence and may be required to take additional courses.",
          "The available programs are:",
          "Guidance in the selection of appropriate courses is available from the School of Engineering Program Counselling Office.",
          "Students lacking specific subject requirements are advised to consult the Recommendations and Notes in Chapter IV--Admission Information - Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.)",
          "Students may also take a minor in another subject area. A maximum of 70% of the requirements of the minor may be applied to meet the requirements of the B.Eng program (i.e., at least 30% of credits required for the minor must not overlap).",
          "Students should note that completion of a minor will require additional credits beyond the total number of credits required for their BEng major. Students intending to acquire a minor should consult with their Program Counsellor. Students cannot earn a minor in the same subject area as their major.",
          "Students may not triple-count a course between a B.Eng. major and two or more minors.",
          "Given the professional and applied nature of the B.Eng. program, there are no double majors associated with the degree.",
          "A maximum of 1.50 credits of core (required) courses may be taken by Letter of Permission for their degree. This cap does not apply to restricted or free electives. Approval of the request for Letter of Permission depends on good standing in the program with a minimum cumulative average of 60%.",
          "Normally, requests for Letter of Permission of a core course will be denied if:",
          "The core course being requested is offered at Guelph in the same semester.",

          "Some courses are not eligible for LOP – for a list of courses, please see the Engineering program guide.",
          "Requests must be accompanied by a full course outline from the host institution, relevant to the offering being requested.",
          "Exceptions to the above terms and conditions will be considered in consultation with the Associate Director Undergraduate Studies for students with documented extenuating circumstances.",
          "Chapter VIII, Undergraduate Degree Regulations & Procedures, defines continuation of study requirements. Most students in the B. Eng. program follow Schedule 6 Regulations, as outlined below. Transfer students from another university or college and students who are readmitted but whose prior record renders them ineligible to proceed under Schedule 6 will follow Schedule 2 (see Chapter VIII). Students will be ineligible to continue in the B.Eng. program and will not be readmitted to the degree program if the same course is failed three times.",
          "Normally, students in the B.Eng. program will be permitted only one supplemental assessment during their studies. It will usually be granted for 3000 or 4000 level courses only.",
          "All degree programs, Open Learning and General Studies have established conditions which must be met for continuation of study. Continuation of study within a program is permitted provided the standards of academic performance listed below are met. In some instances, students not meeting the requirements may be allowed to proceed on probation (see Academic Standing-Probationary(https://calendar.uoguelph.ca/undergraduate-calendar/undergraduate-degree-regulations-procedures/academic-standing/)). If these conditions are not met, the student will be required to withdraw from the program for a minimum of two semesters and may apply for readmission after that period of time.",
          "The continuation of study regulations at the University of Guelph are based on the principle that students must maintain a minimum average of 60%. To allow for transition issues, some leniency has been built into the minimum average requirement during the first 5.25 credit attempts in the B.Eng. program. The student's cumulative average will be reviewed first. If the student's cumulative average does not meet the minimum required, the student will either be required to withdraw or placed on probation. When a student is placed on probation the student will be required to obtain a minimum semester average. In subsequent semesters the student will either be required to withdraw, allowed to continue on probation, or be placed back on regular status. Students will be taken off probation once their cumulative average is greater than, or equal to 60%.",
          "Conditions for continuation of study are applied using the following tables:",
          "B.Eng. students who have attempted between 0.25 and 2.75 credits will be allowed to continue regardless of the cumulative average. Students will be placed on probation if their cumulative average falls below 50%.",

          "To qualify for the degree the student must complete the courses required for a B.Eng. program major and approved elective courses and must achieve an overall minimum cumulative average of at least 60% and a minimum cumulative average of at least 60% in all ENGG courses.",
          "The Co-operative Education program provides an excellent opportunity for students to obtain work experience in industry directly related to their field of study. Students wishing to participate in the Co-operative Education program are encouraged to apply for admission to the Co-op program on entrance. In-course applicants will be considered for admission to the Co-op program following the completion of Semester 2, if space permits.",
          "Students registered in a B.Eng. Co-operative Education program may participate in work-term experience following the completion of the first 4 semesters of study. The Co-operative Education program consists of five co-op work term semesters of experience in industry with employers who participate in the program. Co-op Work Term Reports are graded by a Co-op Faculty Advisor and the Work Performance Evaluation is completed by the co-op employer supervisor rating the student’s work performance during the co-op work term. Evaluations of Co-op semesters are recorded on the student's academic record.",
          "Students interested in applying for admission to the Co-op program should refer to the Co-operative Education Program for Admission requirements and contact a program counsellor and co-op advisor for the B.Eng."
